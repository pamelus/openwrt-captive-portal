# Captive portal for OpenWRT written in LUA

## Overview
This is simple captive portal used by me in conjunction with my [Captive Portal Frontend](https://github.com/pamelus/captive-frontend)
and [AVR token generator](https://github.com/pamelus/avr-token-generator) for [OpenWRT](http://openwrt.org/). It provides
token authentication API and a controlling unit for AVR Token Generator. Appropriate firewall rules are created automatically.
Internet access is given per MAC address after successful token validation.

## Running captive portal on OpenWRT

Please note this captive portal currently works only with firewall3. Since OpenWRT 22.03, OpenWRT uses firewal4 (nftables) by default. firewall4 is not yet
supported by this captive portal.

You need to configure your OpenWRT a bit to make magic happen. This guide assumes that you have already
[configured a guest WLAN on your device](https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan-webinterface).

Once you gave your guest WLAN and firewall zone (`guest`) prepare it to use with captive portal.

1. Disable forwarding from `guest` zone to `wan` zone in general firewall settings, to disable internet connection by
   default.

2. Enable forwarding for validated guests by adding new traffic rule:
    * Address family: IPv4 and IPv6 
	* Protocol: any
	* Source zone: guest
	* Destination zone: wan
	* Action: accept
	* Extra arguments: `-m mark --mark 0x2/0xf`

3. Allow unvalidated guest to see captive portal:
    * Address family: IPv4 and IPv6
    * Protocol: tcp
    * Source zone: guest
    * Destination zone: Device (input)
    * Destination port: 6820-6822  
    * Action: accept
    * Extra arguments: `-m mark --mark 0x0/0xf`

3. Disable password protection (`Encryption: No Encryption` in "Wireless Security" tab), so everyone are able to
   connect and see captive portal.

4. Add custom firewall rules required by captive portal. You will need to install `iptables-mod-extra` if you have not
   do so yet.
	```bash
	opkg update
	opkg install iptables-mod-extra ip6tables-extra
	```

	Then add rules below to your Network / Firewall / Custom Rules.

	```bash
	# Disable redirect for validated guests
	iptables -t nat -A prerouting_guest_rule -m mark --mark 0x2/0xf -j RETURN

	# Allow guests to display captive portal
	iptables -t nat -A prerouting_guest_rule -p tcp --dport 6820:6822 -m addrtype --dst-type LOCAL -j RETURN

	# Handle all HTTP traffic by the router itself
	iptables -t nat -A prerouting_guest_rule -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 6821
	iptables -t nat -A prerouting_guest_rule -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 6821

	# Create allowed guests chain
	iptables -t mangle -N allowed_guests
	iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -i guest -j allowed_guests
 
 	# Add redirections also for IPv6
	ip6tables -t mangle -N redirect_guests
	ip6tables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -i br-guest -j redirect_guests
	
	ip6tables -t mangle -A redirect_guests -m mark --mark 0x2/0xf -j RETURN
	ip6tables -t mangle -A redirect_guests -p tcp --dport 6820:6822 -m addrtype --dst-type LOCAL -j RETURN
	ip6tables -t mangle -A redirect_guests -p tcp --dport 80 -j TPROXY --on-port 6821
	ip6tables -t mangle -A redirect_guests -p tcp --dport 443 -j TPROXY --on-port 6821
	```

5. Install captive portal requirements:

    ```bash
    opkg update
    opkg install libsqlite3 luasql-sqlite3
    ```
   
6. Clone this repository and upload its contents to a known path on your router (eg. `/captive/api`), so that `/captive/api/public_html/captive.lua`
   file exists. On Linux & MacOS you can use deployment script attached: `./deploy.sh root@192.168.1.1:/captive/api`. 
 
7. Clone [Captive Frontend](https://github.com/pamelus/captive-frontend), build it (see captive frontend's readme) and
   upload its `public_html` directory contents to a known path on your router (eg. `/captive/frontend`), so that `/captive/frontend/index.html`
   file exist. 

7. Create `/lib/sqlite` to hold your database files. Database files aren't big, they rarely take more than 100kb, but
   if you're concerned about root disk space, you can change the location by modifying `APPLICATION_DB` in 
   [src/application.lua](src/application.lua)

8. Create uhttpd configuration like this. Please bear in mind this example configuration relies on **UNENCRYPTED**
   traffic, so it's not secure - anyone will be able to sniff entered tokens. Use SSL (eg. from Let's encrypt) to
   address that issue.
   
	```text
	config uhttpd 'captive_api'
		list listen_http '0.0.0.0:6820'
		list listen_http '[::]:6820'
		option redirect_https '0'
		option home '/captive/api/public_html'
		option rfc1918_filter '0'
		option max_requests '3'
		option max_connections '100'
		option cgi_prefix '/'
		option script_timeout '60'
		option network_timeout '30'
		option http_keepalive '20'
		option tcp_keepalive '1'
 
    config uhttpd 'captive_frontend'
		list listen_http '0.0.0.0:6821'
		list listen_http '[::]:6821'
		option home '/captive/frontend'
		option rfc1918_filter '0'
		option max_requests '3'
		option max_connections '100'
		option network_timeout '30'
		option http_keepalive '20'
		option tcp_keepalive '1'
		option error_page '/index.html'
	```

	And restart uhttpd by `/etc/init.d/uhttpd restart`. Have you noticed listen port numbers for frontend match port
    numbers we redirected the traffic to when we were defining firewall rules? 

9. Link & enable init script that validates guest and restores sessions upon boot.

```bash
	ln -s /captive/api/init.d/captive /etc/init.d/captive
	/etc/init.d/captive enable
	/etc/init.d/captive start
```

If everything went good you should now have captive portal working once you connect to your guest WiFi network. To create
token you can use `/etc/init.d/captive token` or build a [token generator](https://github.com/pamelus/avr-token-generator).
To list active sessions use `/etc/init.d/captive list`.

## API Specification

API allows you to authorize users by token. To do so, send a POST request under to `http://ROUTER_IP/captive.lua/auth/token`
with `token` specified as form data. It responds with 200 status code on success, or one of 4xx status codes on failure,
both with a textual status summary.

## Development requirements
All you need is text editor and latest docker compose. You can run application locally by simply:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

Docker container binds localhost port 6820 to lua CGI application, so you can access the API through
`http://localhost:6820`.
